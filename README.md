**From WhatsApp Chats to Structured Project Tasks**

This project transforms WhatsApp chat messages into structured Jira tasks using LLMs (Gemini).

The goal is to provide a seamless user experience where project requirements sent over WhatsApp are automatically parsed, structured into tickets, verified through a UI, and pushed to Jira â€” with confirmation sent back to the user.


ðŸ“Œ Features

WhatsApp Chat Interface
Users send requirements through a familiar chat interface.

AI-powered Parsing (Gemini LLM)
Requirements are parsed and converted into well-structured Jira tickets (title, description, priority, assignee, etc.).

Ticket Verification UI
Parsed tickets are displayed in a simple UI where users can verify, edit, and approve before pushing to Jira.

User Confirmation âœ…
Once a ticket is created in Jira, the user receives a confirmation message on WhatsApp with the generated Jira Ticket ID.

ðŸ›  Tech Stack

Backend: Node.js / Express
